# Lotto-Checker
checks for winning number of LA state lotteries(Pick3, Pick4,  Pick5)


CREATED: FRESHMEN 2023

I had initially aimed to make a web application that would scrape the official Louisiana Lottery website everyday.
I found the current Louisiana lottery app to be very lacking and found some changes that could be done.

THOUGHT THE NOT COMPELETING MY ORIGINAL AIM OF SCRAPING DUE TO LEGAL AND ETHICAL ISSUES.
This project demonstrates a clear demand for a more efficient solution. The current app's UI and logic are a solid foundation. The next evolution of this project would be to build a "backend" component (a server) that could legally and reliably obtain the winning numbers, either through a paid, official API data feed or a more robust, server-side scraping program. This backend could then feed the data to this user-friendly app, finally achieving the original goal of a fully automated checker for the people of Louisiana.
